## Survey analysis
This repo contains the R Markdown notebook (`factor_analysis.Rmd`) for Data Clinic's blog post [Making sense of surveys](https://medium.com/dataclinic/making-sense-of-surveys-754fdc1372ed)

The knit notebook is also available as a GitHub markdown file (`factor_analysis.md`) and the requisite data are present in the `data/` folder.
